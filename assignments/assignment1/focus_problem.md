# Problem: Reading Focus

## Stakeholders
1. **Readers** - those using the app to read and improve their focus
2. **Content creators** - those who provide written content that readers may read - may be authors, professors, researchers, etc
3. **Educators** - those who are trying to get users to read more. May be parents, professors, or friends who want the Reader to read more. 

**Readers** often suffer from difficulty focusing on reading, which may hinder their pursuit of knowledge, entertainment, or education. **Educators** and **content creators**, who have a vested interest in helping people read more, suffer indirectly, as focus issues make the reader less likely to read and understand the content. **Readers** may be able to read faster or with better comprehension as a result of focus aids. **Educators** may then have less difficulty trying to get the reader to read. Similarly, **content creators** may have less difficulty with spreading their message if readers are able to read more easily.

## Features

1. Bionic reading - a toggle for marking text in the style of bionic reading, with certain segments of the word highlighted to provide anchors for reading.

2. Cursor-based emphasization - emphasizing the text around the cursor location, either by highlighting the words around it or graying out paragraphs/lines before and after the cursor. By emphasizing the current location and de-emphasizing other text, it helps remove distractions, break up walls of text, and hone the user’s focus on the current section

3. Focus/Do Not Disturb - turns off notifications and reduces screen clutter in order to prevent external distractions from affecting the user’s focus.
