# Problem: Annotating Books

## Stakeholders
1. **Readers** - those who want to read and annotate their books

2. **Friends** - those who may not want to read the books themselves, but who may want to read the reader’s annotations

3. **Content creators** - those who create content
that others may want to read and discuss

4. **Educators** - those who want to promote group discussion on a subject

**Readers** and **friends** both suffer from the inability/difficulty to write and share annotations. **Educators** may suffer from needing to sift through many comments on a third party platform in order to read and share annotations. **Readers** may benefit from being able to take and search annotations faster and easier. **Friends** and **educators** may benefit from being able to share and see other’s annotations easily. **Content creators** may also have an interest in discussion around their content, as it may contribute to popularity and reading comprehension (i.e. not missing the point of the text). 

## Evidence
1. [PDF Annotation](https://ruttl.com/blog/top-11-free-pdf-annotation-tools-your-ultimate-guide/) - Here is a list of PDF annotation tools. These have many of the same goals as book annotation, but only work on PDFs, rather than EPUBs and other online book formats

2. [Benchmark Universe](https://help.benchmarkuniverse.com/bubateacher/Content/Ebooks/Add%20ebook%20annotations.htm) - This is a tool for, among other things, professors and students to annotate ebooks. It has many of the features that a good solution would have, but only works on the set of books that are included in the Benchmark Universe library, rather than on all books. 

3. [People should annotate books](https://pepperdine-graphic.com/opinion-people-should-annotate-books-even-for-fun/) -An opinion article describing the reasons why people should annotate their books. Includes a number of reasons that annotation is helpful, including to look back on past thoughts and reactions, and immerse yourself deeper in the text.

4. [Annotating Texts](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) - Page from UNC at Chapel Hill on why and how people should annotate their texts. Reasons why include efficiency over taking extensive reading notes. Additionally, they also recommend using web-based annotating software if possible, showing that the act of digitally annotating is both possible and useful.

5. [Search for PDF annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2364947/search-function-for-pdf-annotations) - a Microsoft Support question attempting to figure out how to use the search function on PDF annotations. This shows that people do want the ability to search through their annotations, as well as the fact that it is not possible to do so on Microsoft annotations (without converting all PDFs to word documents, which is a long process). 

6. [Scriptation - Viewing and Searching your Annotations](https://help.scriptation.com/en/article/outline-viewing-and-searching-your-annotations-6opg9t/) -
 This is a support page for Scriptation, which shows how it’s possible to search and view annotations in bulk on the software. This solves a core part of the problem, but the software is only usable for scripts, not books.

7. [How I use Book Tabs to Annotate Books](https://foreverbookedup.com/how-to-use-book-tabs/) - a guide on how to effectively use colored sticky tabs to group physical annotations by theme. This shows that this is something that people want to be able to do, and exists for physical books, but not for digital annotation tools

8. [Why I don't annotate books](https://www.downthebookjar.com/bookish-friends/annotate-books/) - a blog post on why this individual doesn’t annotate books. The main reason is because of how time intensive annotating is, and how cluttered annotating makes the book. These are both problems that could be solved with my solution. 

9. [Sharing annotations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1i8c25e/is_there_a_way_to_share_annotations_between_two/) - A reddit post explaining that the user wants to share their annotations with another user, such that both users can see the annotations that the other makes. The response indicates that if the feature exists at all on the platform, it is in beta mode and isn’t well supported. 


10. [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) - Hypothes.is is a tool for allowing shared discussion and responses between users by sharing annotations of a single text. However, the tool is only available to organizations (like colleges, business, etc), not individuals. 


## Features

1. Annotation tags - users can add tags to annotations, which they can easily filter on. For example, a translation tag for books with sections/words in a different language, or a foreshadowing tag for sections where users predict foreshadowing. Being able to filter for tags will help users find and search existing annotations after the fact.

2. Annotation text search - users can search a book for the text in the annotation, not just the text of the book. Useful for finding an annotation that the user made, but may not remember where in the book it was. 

3. On/Off page views - users can view annotations either overlaid on the book (similar to margin/sticky note annotations) or as an independent list of notes with links to each page in the book. This is good for adapting to the user’s style, and giving users the flexibility to treat annotations as either an embedded supplement to the text or as independent notes that were taken while reading.
