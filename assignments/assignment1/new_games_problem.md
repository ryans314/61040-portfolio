# Problem: Finding New Games and Players

## Stakeholders
1. **Players** - those who want to play board games

2. **Board game companies** - owners of board games

3. **Board game groups** - clubs and organizations that possess games and/or organize game nights

Players may suffer from a lack of people to play games with, or from the cost of buying new board games. Players would benefit from a tool that finds them other players, who may already have other games, preventing them from needing to pay for a new one. Board game companies may be harmed, in that fewer people are buying copies of their games, or benefitted, due to positive experiences with more players playing their games. Similarly, board game groups may benefit from having a tool for recruiting new players, but may also suffer due to a reduced need for such organizations in order to play games.


## Evidence
1. [Gametree](https://gametree.me/) - Gametree is an app for matching players with player groups with certain interests. It addresses the same problem, but the app is incredibly buggy and mildly suspicious. The website boasts 1.5 million users however, showing the demand for a board game player matching service. 


2. [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/132851767828/posts/10161178601432829/) - a post that has many likes, wondering how to find new people to play games with (there are dozens if not hundreds of posts like this on Quora, reddit, board game forums, etc). 


3. [Board Game Ownership Statistics](https://printninja.com/board-game-industry-statistics/#:~:text=And%2C%20an%20impressive%2010.9%25%20own%20more%20than%20100!) - While a majority of people own 1-25 board games, over 20% of households have over 50 board games. This implies that there is a large potential for board game sharing to prevent people from having to buy new board games that others may already possess.

4. [MIT Strategic Games Society](https://printninja.com/board-game-industry-statistics/#:~:text=And%2C%20an%20impressive%2010.9%25%20own%20more%20than%20100!) - MIT has a board games organization, though they only meet ~2 times a week, often focusing on very specific, high activation energy games (like MTG). This is a good solution, but is limited to only certain times and for certain groups of games.


5. [How often people play board games](https://wordsrated.com/board-games-statistics/#:~:text=with%20board%20games%3A-,How%20often%20people%20play%20board%20games,-One%20survey%20of) - according to this article, ~52% of people play board games either weekly or daily. This shows a high demand for board games, and matching players may be particularly useful at places like colleges, where people frequently join and leave, thus disrupting existing gaming groups. 


6. [Why I quit tabletop games](https://3rdworldgeeks.com/2017/09/08/why-i-quit-table-top-games/) - this blog post details why the author quit tabletop gaming, and outlines 3 main reasons. First, there wasn’t a good venue to play; Second, friends couldn’t commit to long or recurring board game sessions; Third, acquiring new games is expensive. All of these issues would be remedied by an app for players to find other players with new/different games. 

7.

Thus, difficulties in finding people to play board games with is a valid problem with a non-zero impact.

8. [www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) - a website for people to meet up and do various events. This is one of the most recommended websites for finding people to play games with, but looking at the website, it seems to be optimized for larger, less casual events rather than for small game nights. The majority of the website is also focused on non-game events. 


9. [Tavern of Tales](https://www.tavernoftales.com/) -  A boston board game cafe/bar. There are many companies like this, which show that people want access to board games and people to play with. However, these often cost money and are inacessible to some groups. 




## Features

1. Public user profiles: users can create a public facing profile describing what they like, how they play (e.g. casual vs competitive), what games they posses/enjoy, etc. This could help players to match with other compatible players.


2. Public game nights: users can create game nights, where they add a list of games they intend to play, set desired experience levels, and other users can sign up to attend, request additional games, etc. This can help players to organize events when they might be free, but when their IRL friends may not be. 


3. Friend groups: users can add each other as friends or join groups, with the intention of sharing events or games within existing groups, rather than to the entire public. This can be useful for facilitating and creating gaming groups, where users can play games with their interested friends or share gaming collections to avoid buying multiple copies of a game.
