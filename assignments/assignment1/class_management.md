# Domain: Class Management

## Description

Classes often have a variety of resources stored in a variety of locations. Some classes have canvas pages, some have their own course websites, some have piazzas, and some have all 3 and more. Keeping track of these resources can quickly become difficult and time consuming.

## My Interest in the Domain

I am currently taking classes at MIT, and I often start every semester fairly unorganized and spend a lot of time just trying to figure out and remember where things are, how to manage my assignments, class times/locations, etc. I frequently find myself wishing that everything was consolidated into a single, well-functioning hub, rather than dispersed between google calendar, canvas, piazza, course websites, course emails, and more.

## Problems

### 1. Tracking Assignments (unselected)
Although I can usually keep track of pset deadlines, a lot of assignments and tasks consist of many smaller tasks and internal deadlines (for example, a journal that needs multiple entries a day, or a group project with daily check ins, etc). While it is technically possible to port everything to a google calendar, it often gets incredibly cluttered at that level of specificity, and it becomes easy to forget or lose track of tasks in that clutter.

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since for most uses, a google calendar would suffice. While it may be useful to make something specialized for college or even for MIT, it probably won't be impressive enough to draw people away from google calendar. Plus, I only have 1.8 semesters left, and I’ve grown accustomed to the bi-yearly struggle of trying to shove everything into a calendar.

### 2. Managing Resources (unselected)
Many classes have multiple resource locations, including canvasses, course websites, piazzas, as well as assignment/exercise-specific websites. While it is theoretically possible to create a google doc or bookmark bar full of these different locations, it’s very time consuming and not very user friendly to do so.

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since there are already many attempted solutions. For example, Notion allows users to make their own pages, which would solve this problem. Additionally, if a solution that I produced wasn’t entirely successful in encompassing all of the necessary tools, then it would become just another place that users have to look to find information, thus worsening the initial problem.

### 3. Classwork Portfolio (unselected)
Many classes (especially in course 6) have students make a lot of interesting and often technically advanced projects. However, these projects are often submitted either directly through a class-specific submission portal, or using an MIT github account, such that evidence of the work is not easily available for public viewing. It would be nice if there was some way for this work to be easily tracked and used on a portfolio that employers could view.

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since it doesn’t seem very feasible to automate the process of taking a project from one platform to another, especially when this could be done by copying code into a github repo without too much effort. Additionally, there may be ethical and legal concerns with confidentiality of course assignments and materials, as well as plagiarism, if students are publishing their coursework.
