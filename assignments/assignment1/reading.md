# Domain: Reading

## Description

I enjoy reading, but find many aspects of the reading process cumbersome or otherwise difficult. For example, I often want to mark certain things while reading, but find writing in the margins or using sticky notes insufficient for looking back through the book except on a full reread. 

## My Interest in the Domain

I used to read a lot before college, but stopped reading for fun/personal enrichment for a couple years due to being hosed and otherwise busy. I’ve started reading recreationally again, and have enjoyed the books I’ve read, but find many aspects of the process (e.g keeping track of new books, annotating books, etc) to be clunky and detract from the experience. 

## Problems

### 1. New Books to Read (unselected)
The number of books that I’d like to read often far exceeds the number of books that I have time to read, and I don’t have/know of a great system for either keeping track of books that I’d want to read, or selecting books to read. At present, I just have a long list of book titles + authors that I was recommended or was interested in reading. However, that is very difficult to navigate, and often leads to me forgetting why I wanted to read the book in the first place. As a result, I often end up either not reading, or picking up the book that I heard about most recently.

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since there exist applications that try to solve this problem (for example, goodreads). While it is definitely possible to improve upon them, I think that it comes with diminishing returns, which isn’t very interesting or useful for a problem that isn’t terribly significant.

### 2. [Annotating Books](annotating_problem.md) 

One problem that I’ve had for a long time with reading is with annotations. Making annotations in the margins or using sticky tabs often feel insufficient, because I’ll often want to find and look at annotations after finishing the book/at a later point without re-reading the whole book. Neither margin or sticky tab annotations are easily searchable, and also often have very limited space. Even on e-readers, it’s rare to be able to give annotations things like tags/categories and be able to search and filter them without going through the individual pages and finding them. It would be nice to have a tool that supports more robust and searchable annotations.

I ultimately **did** select this problem. Although the problem isn’t too serious, it is something that I’ve faced many times, with both physical and digital media, and have a decent amount of experience with. I’ve found that many built-in annotation systems have some pros, but are often very limited in their capabilities, and that it seems few people have tried to implement things like searching or sharing annotations. I also think it has benefits in that it doesn’t require a mass of users to be functional, and potential solutions don’t seem too difficult for the project timeline. 

### 3. [Reading Focus](focus_problem.md)

One incredibly frustrating experience that I’ve had many times while reading is getting distracted or losing focus and re-reading the same paragraph numerous times. Most often, this isn’t even the result of external distractions, but is instead me distracting myself as a result of my thoughts, tiredness, or other internal distractions. I have a variety of strategies to help combat this (such as physically blocking surrounding text with a sheet of paper, highlighting text as I read it, or reading along with a screen reader), but there are also a number of strategies that rely on changing the text/page itself, which I cannot easily do on my own (for example, bionic reading). It would be nice to have an application that can support these strategies, at least for digital media.

I ultimately **did** select this problem, since this is something that I’ve experienced many times, and I feel the solutions are pretty simple to implement, but I’ve never seen a tool have more than a single one of those focusing strategies. Plus, ones that work well are almost always paywalled, making those solutions inaccessible to many people.
