# Domain: Board Games

## Description

I have many board games, and know many people that like board games, but still have not managed to play more than the same few games over and over again. 

## My Interest in the Domain

Growing up, I played many board and card games with my family. However, after coming to college, I found that there were a number of factors that made it difficult to play games with my friends and living group. Some of these factors include:

- People have very busy and rarely overlapping schedules
- People have different skill levels
- People have different tolerances for complexity or game time
- People like/dislike different genres of games

As a result, in my experience, groups often end up playing the same few games every time. I think it would be nice to create some sort of app/website to help facilitate some aspect of this process.


## Problems

### 1. Playing new games (unselected)

Many people will often say they want to try new games, but because large groups without a plan default to the most restrictive need/want, they often end up playing games that everyone knows (e.g. cards against humanity, uno, etc).

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since this isn’t really something an app/system would necessarily help with. While you could make an app where people could vote on a game or express their opinions, this could also be done easily with a google form, a poll, or just over text.

### 2. [Finding new games and players](new_games_problem.md)

 MIT is full of nerds, and there is surely no shortage of people who 1) have interesting games, and 2) want to play those games. However, it can often be difficult to find players at any given time, since the people around you may be busy. Surely there must be a better solution than planning out game nights weeks in advance, only for many of the attendees to cancel because they’re hosed.

I ultimately **did** select this problem, since I know a lot of people that would find value in a tool to help find people/times to play games with, and think that working on the project would be enjoyable because of the use that would come from it. Additionally, I have a few ideas for solutions/features that aren’t really present in existing applications, which aren’t too terribly complex for the scope of the class. 

### 3. Matching skill levels (unselected)

 For many competitive, strategy-based games (like chess, go, stratego, etc), it’s not fun to play between people of vastly different skill levels. For the more advanced player, they’re not challenged and may feel bad about beating the less advanced player. For the less advanced player, they may be struggling excessively and feel bad about their own skill level. 

I ultimately **did not select** this problem, since this would likely suffer from a lack of critical mass, as the app would need a large user base for users to be able to match with each other.
