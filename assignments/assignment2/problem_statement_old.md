# Task 1: Problem Statement

## Problem Domain

**Reading** 

I enjoy reading, but often struggle to interact with ebooks and other digital materials to the same degree as with physical books and papers. Where I would usually write in the margins, use color-coded sticky notes, and highlight the pages, it's very difficult to do similar interactions on digital media. Additionally, as more content switches from physical to digital (for example, newspapers) I find myself increasingly needing to adapt to digital content. 

## Problem

**Digital Annotations**

A problem that many readers (of digital content) face is a lack of ability to make useful annotations. When reading digital content, users may want to write down their thoughts, mark recurring themes or notable ideas, and make connections between sections of the text. After reading, users may also want to search through and filter their annotations, or share them with other users. It would be nice to have a tool that supports more robust and searchable annotations.

## Stakeholders

1. **Readers** - those who want to read and annotate their books

2. **Friends** - those who may not want to read the books themselves, but who may want to read the reader’s annotations

3. **Content creators** - those who create content
that others may want to read and discuss

4. **Educators** - those who want to promote group discussion on a subject

**Readers** and **friends** both suffer from the inability/difficulty to write and share annotations. **Educators** may suffer from needing to sift through many comments on a third party platform in order to read and share annotations. **Readers** may benefit from being able to take and search annotations faster and easier. **Friends** and **educators** may benefit from being able to share and see other’s annotations easily. **Content creators** may also have an interest in discussion around their content, as it may contribute to popularity and reading comprehension (i.e. not missing the point of the text). 

## Evidence

1. [People should annotate books](https://pepperdine-graphic.com/opinion-people-should-annotate-books-even-for-fun/) -An opinion article describing the reasons why people should annotate their books. Includes a number of reasons that annotation is helpful, including to look back on past thoughts and reactions, and immerse yourself deeper in the text.

2. [Annotating Texts](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotating-texts/) - Page from UNC at Chapel Hill on why and how people should annotate their texts. Reasons why include efficiency over taking extensive reading notes. Additionally, they also recommend using web-based annotating software if possible, showing that the act of digitally annotating is both possible and useful.

3. [Search for PDF annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2364947/search-function-for-pdf-annotations) - a Microsoft Support question attempting to figure out how to use the search function on PDF annotations. This shows that people do want the ability to search through their annotations, as well as the fact that it is not possible to do so on Microsoft annotations (without converting all PDFs to word documents, which is a long process). 

4. [How I use Book Tabs to Annotate Books](https://foreverbookedup.com/how-to-use-book-tabs/) - a guide on how to effectively use colored sticky tabs to group physical annotations by theme. This shows that this is something that people want to be able to do, and exists for physical books, but not for digital annotation tools

5. [Why I don't annotate books](https://www.downthebookjar.com/bookish-friends/annotate-books/) - a blog post on why this individual doesn’t annotate books. The main reason is because of how time intensive annotating is, and how cluttered annotating makes the book. These are both problems that could be solved with my solution. 

6. [Sharing annotations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1i8c25e/is_there_a_way_to_share_annotations_between_two/) - A reddit post explaining that the user wants to share their annotations with another user, such that both users can see the annotations that the other makes. The response indicates that if the feature exists at all on the platform, it is in beta mode and isn’t well supported.
