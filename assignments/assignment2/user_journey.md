# Task 5 - User Journey

Atlas is a student in college. They want to read more academic papers to gain a better understanding of their course content, but struggle to focus through long and dense papers with small text. 

Atlas discovers FocusReader, and decides to give it a try. They first create an account by putting in a username and password, and are then directed to the Library page. It currently shows "No documents added" and a button to add a new document. They click the button, upload their pdf, and title it "Microbial Fuel Cells Lit review"

They see the "Microbial Fuel..." document on the library page, and click on it to move to the document view. The document looks exactly the same as the PDF, but Atlas notices a bar at the top with various text settings. Atlas increases the font size and line height, making the page a lot easier to read. They also enable Bionic Text, which bolds the first syllable of each word. They find it easier to pay attention to the text, and end up spacing out less and comprehending it better on the first try. 

When Atlas encounters some suspicious statistical methods, they decide to annotate the paragraph by highlighting the text, creating a text annotation that says "Hmm... not sure if a p-test with n=7 and p=0.056 is actually statistically significant" and tags it with a new tag titled "Sus". After they finish reading, they might go back and follow up on annotations tagged "sus" to re-assess whether the paper's conclusions are valid. 

After Atlas finishes reading a few more sections, they decide to exit the document and look at the "Reading History" section to see how much work they did. They find that they read the paper for over an hour, and made 8 annotations, and feel very proud of themself. They look forward to finishing the paper later.
