# Task 1: Problem Statement

## Problem Domain

**Reading** 

I enjoy reading, but nowadays don't read as much as I'd like. In addition to novels (for recreation), I also read technical documents (e.g. research papers and technical articles) for classes. I find that I'm not reading as deeply or broadly as I could, and I often get distracted when reading dense or long material. I'd like to find ways to make reading for long periods of time easier and increase understanding of materials.  

## Problem

**Reading Focus**

One incredibly frustrating experience that I’ve had many times while reading is getting distracted or losing focus and re-reading the same paragraph numerous times. Most often, this isn’t even the result of external distractions, but is instead me distracting myself as a result of my thoughts, tiredness, or other internal distractions. I have a variety of strategies to help combat this (such as physically blocking surrounding text with a sheet of paper, highlighting text as I read it, or reading along with a screen reader), but there are also a number of strategies that rely on changing the text/page itself, which I cannot easily do on my own (for example, bionic reading). It would be nice to have an application that can support these strategies, at least for digital media.

## Stakeholders
1. **Readers** - those using the app to read and improve their focus
2. **Content creators** - those who provide written content that readers may read - may be authors, professors, researchers, etc
3. **Educators** - those who are trying to get users to read more. May be parents, professors, or friends who want the Reader to read more. 

**Readers** often suffer from difficulty focusing on reading, which may hinder their pursuit of knowledge, entertainment, or education. **Educators** and **content creators**, who have a vested interest in helping people read more, suffer indirectly, as focus issues make the reader less likely to read and understand the content. **Readers** may be able to read faster or with better comprehension as a result of focus aids. **Educators** may then have less difficulty trying to get the reader to read. Similarly, **content creators** may have less difficulty with spreading their message if readers are able to read more easily. 

## Evidence
1. [I try to read but can't stay focused](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3qe6bk/i_try_to_read_but_i_cant_stay_focused/) - A reddit post with hundreds of upvotes expressing difficulty staying focused while reading, and needing to re-read a page many times before understanding it

2. [11 ways to improve your focus while reading](https://chatter-bug.com/2024/06/26/11-ways-to-improve-your-focus-while-reading/) - an article describing some of the causes of difficulty focusing on reading that people may experience, and a list of solutions. One of the solutions includes finding a book format that works best for the user, like using ebooks or using focus-increasing apps/extensions. 

3. [Omoguru](https://www.omoguru.com/) - omoguru, a web application that lets users change the font, line spacing, and other typographic elements in order to improve ease of reading. This solves a similar problem of making reading less difficult and more comfortable, but is limited to the scope of fonts/typographic elements. It also appears to not be free, and thus is not broadly accessible.

4. [Reading Workarounds](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/trouble-reading-try-these-workarounds-2019062717242) - a harvard health blog post about some causes and tips for difficulty reading. Some tips include things like revealing one line of text at a time, or using larger fonts on e-readers. These are tips that would be good to incorporate in the app

5. [Adult Reading Report UK](https://readingagency.org.uk/adult-reading-research-report-2024/) - a set of studies on adult reading in the UK, which shows that almost 30% of adults struggle to focus on reading for “more than a few minutes.” Additionally, 42% of young adults from 16-34 report having difficulty focusing when reading.
